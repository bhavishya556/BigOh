Explanation of Code:
Class Declaration and Syntax:

We start by defining a class using the class keyword.

We define a constructor method that initializes the properties.

The greet() method is an instance method, called on instances of the class.

Constructor:

The constructor() method is called when we create a new instance of a class (new Car(...)).

It initializes instance properties like brand and model for a Car.

Instance Properties and Methods:

Instance properties (like name, age) are initialized via the constructor and accessed using this.

Instance methods, like describe(), operate on the properties of a specific instance.

Role of this in Classes:

this refers to the current object (instance) within the class.

It is used to access instance properties and methods.

Inheritance:

The Dog class extends the Animal class using the extends keyword, allowing it to inherit methods like describe().

The super() function is used to call the parent class's constructor.

Getter and Setter Methods:

Getters and setters allow controlled access to object properties.

The area getter calculates the area based on the width and height.

The width setter ensures that only valid values are assigned to the width property.

Static Methods:

Static methods are defined using the static keyword and are invoked on the class itself, not an instance.

Static methods are useful for utility functions (like Calculator.add()).

Private Methods and Fields:

Private fields are denoted using #. They cannot be accessed directly outside the class.

Private methods and fields allow for better encapsulation of data.

Summary:
Classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar over prototypes, providing a more structured approach to creating and managing objects.

Instance properties and methods are the core functionality of objects created from a class.

Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit properties and methods from a superclass.

Getters and setters allow you to control the reading and writing of properties.

Static methods are useful when you want a method that works on the class itself, not an instance.

Private fields and methods ensure encapsulation by restricting direct access outside the class.

This structure can be easily copied and used as a reference in your code!
