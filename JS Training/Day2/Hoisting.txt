-Function Declarations:
Function declarations are entirely hoisted, meaning you can call them before they are declared in the code. 

-Variable Declarations (with var):
Variable declarations using var are also hoisted, but their initial values are set to undefined. 

-Variables (with let and const):
While variables declared with let and const are also hoisted, they are not initialized. This means attempting to access them before their declaration will result in a ReferenceError.
